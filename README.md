# Coffee Sales Dashboard


## Objective
I did some practice using INDEX, VLOOKUP, and conditional statement in Microsoft Excel. Then, I did EDA by making pivot tables from the data. Last, I made Sales Dashboard which include: total sales overtime, sales by country, top 5 customers. The total sales overtime can be categorized by Roast Type, Size, and Loyalty Card ownership.
